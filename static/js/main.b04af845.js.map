The fillPriority property makes it really easy to toggle between different fill types.  For example, if you want to toggle between a fill color style and a fill pattern style, simply set the fill property and the fillPattern properties, and then use setFillPriority('color') to render the shape with a color fill, or use setFillPriority('pattern') to render the shape with the pattern fill configuration\n\t     * @param {String} [config.stroke] stroke color\n\t     * @param {Number} [config.strokeWidth] stroke width\n\t     * @param {Boolean} [config.strokeHitEnabled] flag which enables or disables stroke hit region.
